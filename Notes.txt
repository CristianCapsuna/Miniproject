1) Should I add uniqueness of values in the database?
2) ORDERS ARE ALWAYS CREATED WITH STATUS ID 1 SO IF THAT'S NOT PREPARING THEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.
3) Cannot delete things
4) When I set up foreing keys, it either doesn't work or doesn't let me delete my order
5) Back tick when inputting price of product throws error.
